## Summary

In this project, I am tasked to tackle the eight-puzzle with A* search algorithms. An A* algorithm explores a search space by prioritizing the states that appear most promising and expanding that state’s subproblems. We determine a state’s success value by f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) represents the cost to reach the current state from the initial state and h(n) is a heuristic estimate of the remaining distance from the current state to the goal. Heuristics sets A* apart by combining the actual path cost with an informed approach, making it more effective than other search algorithms. The variants I will cover are Uniform Cost Search, A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic, and A* with the Manhattan Distance heuristic. These three algorithms differ only in how they define h(n), and this report will create the comparisons to showcase the impact of these differences on solving eight-puzzles of varying depths.
